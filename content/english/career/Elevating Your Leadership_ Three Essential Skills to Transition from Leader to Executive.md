# üíé **Mastering the Shift: Preparing Leaders for Executive Success**
As professionals climb the corporate ladder, the transition from leader to executive is marked by an evolution that demands more than just experience and tenure. 

It requires a deliberate shift in skills and mindset, reflecting the broader strategic responsibilities that come with executive roles. This shift isn't merely about scaling existing competencies, but also about developing new abilities that align with the demands of high-level decision-making and organizational leadership.

The article "[Three Crucial Skills that Leaders Must Develop to Become Executives](https://theskip.substack.com/p/three-crucial-skills-that-leaders)" by Nikhyl Singhal delves into this transformative process. It outlines the fundamental skills that are essential for any leader looking to make the successful leap to executive roles.

# üß†**Key Lessons From 'Three Crucial Skills that Leaders Must Develop to Become Executives'**
## **Lesson 1: Ideally, your career will go through three acts.**

Act I is the ‚Äúsetup.‚Äù It‚Äôs where you transition from being an individual contributor to a leader. Act II is your transition from a leader to an executive. And Act III is where you start your second career, hopefully unconstrained by previous financial and personal needs. I‚Äôll devote a future newsletter to Act III, as I find myself close to that point and actively thinking about how to maximize impact and joy in this phase.

**Act I - The Setup**: This initial phase is where professionals transition from being individual contributors to leaders within their organizations. 

It involves refining core skills, managing increasingly ambiguous problems with minimal guidance, and beginning to manage teams and later managers. This phase sets the foundational skills and leadership abilities necessary for advanced roles.

**Act II - From Leader to Executive**: This middle phase marks the transition from being a leader to an executive. It's characterized by a need for different skills than those that proved successful in Act I. 

Leaders in this phase face more complex challenges and must develop advanced soft skills, such as the ability to influence and manage emotions, and strategic thinking to navigate less defined scenarios. 

This phase often requires embracing new challenges, taking calculated risks, and potentially changing roles to gain new experiences essential for growth.

**Act III - Second Career**: In the later stages of their professional lives, individuals might start a second career, often unconstrained by earlier financial or personal needs. 

This phase allows for leveraging extensive experience to either give back through mentoring, engage in different industries, or pursue passions that were not previously prioritized.

## ü§î **How to Apply to My Career?**

1. **Develop a Strategic Career Plan**: Begin by mapping out your career in three phases. Recognize where you are currently and plan specific goals and milestones for reaching the next phase. This includes identifying the skills and experiences required to move from leadership to executive roles.

2. **Focus on Skill Development**: In Act I, the focus is on mastering your role as a leader, which includes refining problem-solving skills and managing teams effectively. As you prepare for Act II, prioritize developing strategic thinking, advanced negotiation skills, and the ability to influence across the organization without direct authority. Enroll in leadership development programs, seek challenging projects, and stay updated on industry trends.

## **Lesson 2: To ascend into an elite role professionally, you need different skills in Act II from what led to your success in Act I.**
Though a successful career requires a blend of soft and hard skills, when you start out, hard skills are considerably more important. But as you head into Act II, your soft skills are more critical to your success. In fact, the professional world is littered with insanely talented leaders who never became executives because they simply didn‚Äôt learn how to improve themselves, influence others, or manage their emotions.

Imagine the career journey as navigating a ship. Early in the journey (Act I), the focus is on technical skills akin to knowing how to operate the ship's machinery, navigate by maps, and understand the sea's conditions‚Äîthese are your hard skills. 

However, as one moves into a role akin to that of a ship's captain (Act II), the responsibilities extend beyond mere operation. 
A captain must manage the crew, handle crises diplomatically, and make judgment calls in unforeseen situations. 

This shift from sailor to captain requires a robust set of soft skills: leadership, emotional intelligence, and communication are crucial for maintaining morale, making strategic decisions, and leading the ship safely through storms.
The example underlines that while technical expertise may secure a leadership position, soft skills are indispensable in rising to and succeeding in executive roles. Leaders who fail to develop these skills often struggle with the broader, more nuanced challenges of executive responsibilities. 

They might be unable to inspire loyalty, lead effectively during crises, or maintain a positive corporate culture‚Äîfactors that can limit their advancement and impact as executives.

## ü§î **How to Apply to My Career?**

1. **Continuous Learning and Training**: Invest in personal development programs that focus on leadership, communication, conflict resolution, and emotional intelligence. Workshops, seminars, and courses can provide the tools and knowledge needed to improve these skills.

2. **Practice Active Listening**: Improve your communication skills by practicing active listening. This involves fully concentrating on the speaker, understanding their message, responding thoughtfully, and remembering the discussion. This skill is crucial for building trust and fostering open communication.

3. **Role-Playing Scenarios**: Participate in role-playing exercises that simulate difficult conversations, negotiations, or leadership challenges. These exercises can help you practice and refine your approach to real-world scenarios, improving your ability to influence and lead effectively.

## **Lesson 3: Trust others, not just yourself.**
With this added responsibility, at first you might just end up working harder and increasing your level of engagement. Up to this point, your success has mainly come from making good decisions and mastering the details. So naturally, as the problem space gets bigger, you increase focus and absorb more context. Sadly, there are only so many hours in a day and your capacity is finite. So on your path to becoming an executive, mastering each detail will hold you back. You‚Äôll need to develop a new, crucial skill: building teams and trusting the people in them.

Consider the role of an orchestra conductor. Initially, a musician must master their instrument, understanding every nuance and detail of their own performance, much like a professional mastering individual tasks. 
However, as a conductor, success no longer hinges solely on one's personal ability to play an instrument but rather on the ability to lead and harmonize the collective performance of an entire orchestra. The conductor must trust each musician's expertise and ability to play their part. They don't play every instrument but guide and trust others to contribute effectively, creating a harmonious and powerful symphony.
By trusting others, leaders can expand their impact and navigate the complexities of executive roles more effectively, ensuring that the organization operates efficiently and cohesively under their guidance.

## ü§î **How to Apply to My Career?**

1. **Delegate Effectively**: Begin by identifying tasks and responsibilities that you can delegate to your team members. Choose tasks that match their skills and developmental goals. Effective delegation not only reduces your workload but also empowers your team, giving them opportunities to grow and prove their capabilities.
2. **Set Clear Expectations and Guidelines**: When delegating, be clear about what success looks like. Provide all necessary information, deadlines, and the desired outcomes. Clear communication prevents misunderstandings and ensures that everyone is aligned with the objectives.
3. **Develop Feedback Mechanisms**: Establish regular check-ins and feedback sessions to monitor progress without micromanaging. This allows you to stay informed and offer guidance when necessary, while still giving your team the autonomy they need to handle tasks on their own.
# üîñ **Key Takeaways**

1. Ideally, your career will go through three acts.
2. To ascend into an elite role professionally, you need different skills in Act II from what led to your success in Act I.
3. Trust others, not just yourself
